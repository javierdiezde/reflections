When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    whan i want to share some files, or i want store in the cloud or i want to work with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because you make commits when it is necessary

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   Forks are copy in the cloud of a repository, you do clones for your computer and branches are for doing different stuff in the project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   You don`t have different versions of the code and you can make changes knowing what is the real state of the project

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    you must send all your changes to other person and attach all files you changes and may be the others, or you must work in Drive or something like that.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You are free to change what you want without fear to destroy the project and you can share only the changes you made with other people.
